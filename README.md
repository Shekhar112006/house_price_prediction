🏠 House Price Prediction ML Project
Project Overview

This is a Machine Learning project to predict house prices based on features like area, bedrooms, and bathrooms.
The project demonstrates Python modular coding, data preprocessing, model training, and prediction using Linear Regression.

Features

Clean modular structure:
data_preprocessing.py → Load and split dataset
model_training.py → Train and evaluate model
predict.py → Make predictions
Uses Linear Regression from scikit-learn
Easy to extend with new algorithms
Fully GitHub-ready and professional

How to Run
Open notebook/main.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Run all cells in order.The notebook will:
Load and split the dataset
Train the Linear Regression model
Evaluate the model
Predict house price for new inputs

Future Improvements
Add more features (location, year built, etc.)
Use advanced ML models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
Create a web app using Flask or Streamlit for live predictions
Add visualizations for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
